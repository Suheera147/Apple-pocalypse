# Apple-pocalypse
A basic shooting game using OpenGL library in C language. Target objects (apples) are generated with random colour and random points. Target with higher points move faster. The shooter (a doctor) shoots a bullet at the apples when the space-bar is pressed. The doctor can be moved using the up and down arrow keys. Upon successfully shooting an apple, the apple disappears and its score is added to your total score. The game ends after 20 seconds.
